# Console-Finances

I was tasked with creaating a code analyzing the financial records for company xyz.
The end result was to write a javascript code that calculate the following;

.The total number of months included in the dataset.
.The net total amount of Profit/Losses over the entire period.
.The average of the changes in Profit/Losses over the entire period.
.The greatest increase in Profit/Losses (date and difference in the amounts) over the entire
period.
.The greatest decrease in Profit/Losses (date and difference in the amounts) over the entire
period.
