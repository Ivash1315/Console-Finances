# Console-Financial-Analysis_JS


I was tasked with creaating a code analyzing the financial records for company xyz

  The end result was to write a javascript code that calculate the following;

- The total number of months included in the dataset
- The net total amount of Profit/Losses over the entire period.
- The average of the changes in Profit/Losses over the entire period.
- The greatest increase in Profit/Losses (date and difference in the amounts) over the entire
period.
- The greatest decrease in Profit/Losses (date and difference in the amounts) over the entire
period.
